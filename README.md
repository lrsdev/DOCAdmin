This is a rails application developed as a component of the Dogs on Beaches application for a third year project at the Otago Polytechnic.

The purpose of this application is to provide an administration interface for the system.

This project was merged with the user facing rails application into a monolithic application at http://github.com/lrsdev/dog-rails
